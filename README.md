Game Rules

    The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of squares.
    Each player chooses a game marker: either "X" or "O".
    Players take turns placing their markers on the game board by selecting the square they want to place their marker in.
    The player who first gets a line of three markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction wins the game.
    If all squares on the game board are filled and neither player has a line of three markers, the game ends in a draw.
